COMMON LAYER INTERFACE (CLI)

VERSION 2.0

Introduction
The Common Layer Interface (CLI) is a universal format for the input of geometry data to model fabrication systems based on layer manufacturing technologies (LMT). It is suitable for systems using layer-wise photo-curing of resin, sintering or binding of powder, cutting of sheet material, solidification of molten material, and any other systems which build models on a layer-by-layer basis.

CLI is intended as a simple, efficient and unambiguous format for data input to all LMT-based systems, based on a "2 1/2D" layer representation. It is independent of vendors or fabrication machines, and should require only a simple conversion to the vendor-specific internal data structure of the machine. The obligatory parts of the format are also application independent, while the USERDATA command allows user- or application-specific data to be defined in the header. This flexibility allows the format to be used for a wide range of applications, without loss of important information and without excluding data transfer between different applications. One specific application, medical scan data, is already accommodated with appropriate user data. Others can be added as they are defined.

Comments and suggestions for future versions are welcome, and should be forwarded to one of the contacts named in Appendix A.

1. Definitions and general conventions

1.1. 2 1/2D-Representation
The geometrical information of the intersection of a 3D-model with a plane is called a slice. The volume between two parallel slices is called a layer. The 2 1/2D-representation of a model is the sum total of layer-descriptions. The slicing plane is parallel to the xy- plane of a right hand cartesian coordinate system. It is assumed that the building direction is the positive z-axis.

1.2. Layer
A layer is the volume between two parallel slices, and is defined by its thickness, a set of contours and (optionally) hatches.

1.3. Contour
Contours represent the boundaries of solid material within a layer, and are defined by polylines (section 1.4). They are classified as internal and external contours (Fig.1). For correct interpretation each contour must be closed and must not intersect itself or another contour.


               (Fig 1)
1.4. Polyline
A polyline is defined by a set of vertex points (x,y), connected contiguously in the listed order by straight line segments. A closed polyline can also be called a polygon.

1.5. Hatches
A hatch is a set of independent straight lines, each defined by one start and one end point (x,y). The purpose of hatches and open polylines is to define support structures or filling structures to obtain a solid model, which are necessary for some LMT systems.

2. ASCII Data Format

2.1. File Structure
The ASCII-file is separated into sections. Each section is marked by a start and an end marker. Only the characters A...Z, a...z, , ., 0...9, $ and the separators (section 2.4) are interpreted. All other characters will be ignored. Each file must have a HEADER-section and a GEOMETRY-section. Other sections are optional. The start of the HEADER-section will be interpreted as the start of data, and the end of the GEOMETRY-section as the end of data. Data may be included before the HEADER-section and after the GEOMETRY-section, but will be ignored.

2.2. General Syntax
All commands have the general form:

Keyword/parameter

Keyword and parameter are separated by the character "/" (oblique stroke). If there are no parameters there should be no oblique stroke. The only exception to this rule is the command "//" (see description below).

2.2.1. Keywords
Keywords are names according to the language description defined below. All keywords are written in ASCII upper case notation. Every keyword must start with the sequence "$$".

2.2.2. Parameters
Parameters are numbers or ASCII-strings separated by the character "," (comma).

2.3. Numbers
INTEGER:

+/- k1...kn : every ki is a number from 0 to 9.
Negative numbers must have a minus sign, positive numbers can have a plus sign. Numbers with no sign are interpreted as positive. Maximum range is +/- 2^31.

REAL:

+/- x1...xn.y1...ym
n >= 0, m >= 0
1 <= (n + m) <= realim
xi,yi are numbers from 0 to 9, respectively before and after the decimal point. Realim is the maximum number of digits within a REAL and is limited to 16. A decimal point is required for all REAL numbers.

2.4. Separators
Separators are "/" (oblique stroke), "," (comma) and "//" (double stroke).

2.5. ASCII-strings
An ASCII-string is any number of valid characters enclosed within double-quotes. Valid characters are all printable characters except the double-quotes.

3. ASCII Language Description
3.1. Non geometric commands

3.1.1. Comments
Command : remark
Syntax : // text //

This is an exception to the general syntax. The text between the // commands will be interpreted as a comment. Within the comment the double stroke is not allowed.

3.1.2. Structure

Syntax : $$HEADERSTART

This command starts the HEADER-section, and will be interpreted as the start of data.
___________

Command : end header
Syntax : $$HEADEREND
This command ends the HEADER-section.
___________

Syntax : $$UNITS/u
Parameter u : REAL
u indicates the units of the coordinates in mm.
__________

Command : version is v
Syntax : $$VERSION/v
Parameter v : integer
v divided by 100 gives the version number.
For example 200 --> Version 2.00
__________

All following HEADER-commands are optional.

Command : file was built on date
Syntax : $$DATE/d
Parameter d : integer
d will be interpreted in the sequence DDMMYY.

Parameters:
x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2 : REAL

Describes the dimensions of the outline box which completely contains the part in absolute coordinates (in mm) with respect to the origin. The conditions x1 < x2 , y1 < y2 and z1 < z2 must be satisfied.
___________

Command : number of layers inside the file is i
Syntax : $$LAYERS/i
Parameter i : INTEGER
The Parameter i indicates the number of layers inside the file.
___________

Command : align data in GEOMETRY-section to 32 bit (for binary GEOMETRY-section only)
Syntax : $$ALIGN

Sets the alignment of geometry-data to 32 bit. The command only takes effect in case of a binary GEOMETRY-section. The GEOMETRY-section must start at the beginning of a 32-bit-word. The HEADER-section must end at the end of a 32-bit- word. Every data item within the GEOMETRY-section must start at the beginning of a 32-bit-word. A pair of coordinates (x,y) is seen as one data item. For the commands start polyline short and start hatches short a pair of coordinates (x,y) are to be written into one 32-bit-word.

Example:
($$ALIGN in HEADER-section)

Byte	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9........
	127	#	#	#	4	1	#	#	129....
___________
Command : set a label for a part
Syntax : $$LABEL/id,text

Parameter
id : INTEGER
text : ASCII-string
id: Identifier to allow more than one model information in one file. For every id used in the commands start polyline (short/long/ASCII) and start hatches (short/long/ASCII) there shall be one command $$LABEL. Each id causes the building-process to build a different part.

text: An ASCII string that gives some comment on the part.
___________

Syntax : $$LAYER/z
Parameter z : REAL
Start of a layer with upper surface at height z (z*units [mm]). All layers must be sorted in ascending order with respect to z. The thickness of the layer is given by the difference between the z values of the current and previous layers. A thickness for the first (lowest) layer can be specified by including a "zero-layer" with a given z value but with no polyline.
___________

Command : start polyline
Syntax : $$POLYLINE/id,dir,n,p1x,p1y,...pnx,pny
Parameters:

	id		: INTEGER
	dir,n		: INTEGER
	p1x..pny	: REAL

id : identifier to allow more than one model information in one file.
id refers to the parameter id of command $$LABEL (HEADER-section).
dir : Orientation of the line when viewing in the negative z-direction
0 : clockwise (internal)
1 : counter-clockwise (external)
2 : open line (no solid)
n : number of points
p1x..pny : coordinates of the points 1..n
Polylines representing internal contours must be clockwise, polylines representing external contours counter-clockwise (Fig 2). This orientation must be valid for the parameter "dir" and for the order the points are listed. The value of "dir " overwrites the order of listed points if there is a mismatch.

In the case of closed polylines (dir = 0,1) p1x = pnx and p1y = pny must be valid. The open line value for the dir flag can be used to indicate a non-closed polyline. This can be used as an input for correction and editing tools based on the CLI format.

5. Binary Data Format
5.1. File structure

The binary-data-file is separated into two sections : a header-section in ASCII data format and a geometry-section in binary data format. For header-section commands see section 3.1.3.

The start of the header-section will be interpreted as start of data.
The end of the geometry-section will be interpreted as the end of data.
The end of the header-section must be indicated by a $$HEADEREND command.
The geometry-section must directly follow the header-section (directly after the command $$HEADEREND) without any kind of information (carriage return, line feed etc.) in between.

5.2. General Binary Syntax
All commands have the following general form:
CommandIndex,p1,p2,...pn
There is no separator between Command Index and parameters, nor within the parameter-section.

5.2.1. Command Index (CI)
Command Index is a number (unsigned integer) indicating the command according to the command list below.

5.2.2. Parameters
The parameters p1.. pn are numbers according the specification below.

5.3. Numbers
Numbers are specified using the IEEE standard.

Appendix A - Development of the Common Layer Interface (CLI)
Development of the Common Layer Interface (CLI) originated in the Brite-EuRam Project "Rapid Prototyping Techniques", whose work programme identified the following need:

"Problems with the current STL interface (triangle model) force us to look for a new data format for general LMT-processes, which may only contain cross section information... The section oriented information should be vendor independent."

Simultaneously, the Brite-EuRam Project "Phidias" was working to establish and make available an interface between medical scan data and layer manufacturing technologies. Cooperation between these two projects, together with comments and contributions from third parties, led to the development of CLI version 2.0.

Further development and dissemination of the CLI is also continuing in cooperation with EARP (the European Action on Rapid Prototyping), an organization of companies and institutions throughout Europe which are actively working with rapid prototyping. The up-to- date version of CLI is (from September 1994) continuously available to Internet users under the World Wide Web, at the address given on the next page. This also provides a forum for Internet users to discuss their use of CLI and make suggestions.

Alternatively, copies of the CLI specification can be obtained from the Brite EuRam project contacts listed.

Appendix B - Header section for medical applications
Introduction

This appendix describes a proposal for a $$USERDATA header section (see 3.1.3) to be used for medical applications.

The extension of the CLI-Header proposed here describes the absolute minimum of labeling considered necessary for medical applications. The definitions are part of work performed within the Brite-Euram project Phidias towards the development of a format for the exchange of segmentation results.

The additions are primarily inserted in order to achieve unambiguous documentation and labeling of the history of the data generation process and of the patient orientation in medical applications. For the actual model building process they can be ignored. The CLI-file generation programm must ensure that if x- and y-coordinates and the positive z-direction are interpreted as righthand system, an anatomically correct model will result! With respect to the coordinate interpretation the following assumptions common in slice oriented imaging modalities are made:

The "volume"/"model"/"stack of layers" coordinate system is defined as a righthand system with the following properties

*	x- and y-axis lie within the image/layer plane with
			(x) pointing from left to right
			(y) pointing from top  to bottom
*	The z-axis is orthogonal to the slice/image/layer plane with
			(z) pointing into the image plane
*	The patient orientation is described by another righthand system defined by three base 
vectors:
 	medial-rightlateral	(nose->right ear)	as x-axis
 	posterior-anterior	(spine->chest)		as y-axis: "FRONT-VECTOR"
 	caudo-cranial		(foot->head)		as z-axis: "HEAD-VECTOR"
The "cartesian coordinates" of HEAD-VECTOR and FRONT-VECTOR in the layer coordinate system fully specify the patient orientation! Gantry tilt must be taken into account when converting image matrix coordinates into the layer coordinate system! For the sake of simplicity gantry tilt will be ignored, however, when describing patient orientation (the same effect is caused by putting the patient on a slanted couch).


The following three examples use the definitions
	axial:		orthogonal to HEAD-VECTOR
	coronal:	orthogonal to FRONT-VECTOR
	sagittal:	contains HEAD-VECTOR and FRONT-VECTOR


Example 1:	Patient in prone position, axial images reconstructed looking
		in the cranial direction
			HEAD-VECTOR  = ( 0,  0,  1)
			FRONT-VECTOR = ( 0, 1,  0)

Example 2:	Coronal reconstructions looking onto the chest of the patient
			HEAD-VECTOR  = ( 0, -1,  0)
			FRONT-VECTOR = ( 0,  0, -1)

Example 3:	Sagittal reconstructions looking from the right to the left
		side of the patient
			HEAD-VECTOR  = ( 0, -1,  0)
			FRONT-VECTOR = ( 1,  0,  0)

Syntax

The $$USERDATA section of the CLI-Header (3.1.3) contains information in ASCII-format of 
the following form (see also page 11)
		userdata:		{userdata-item}...{userdata-item}
		userdata-item:		keyword=text "/0"	("/0" = binary zero)

The following keywords are possible 
	institution-id		Institution where primary data were generated
	source-id		Additional information specifying the creation of
				this file, eg. software package and person generating
				the data set
	patient-id		Qualifier uniquely specifying the patient
	study-id		Qualifier specifying the type of study performed
	examination-date	Date on which examination was performed
	slice-thickness	Slice thickness in mm
	matrix-size		Size of the image matrix (typically 512)
	pixel-size		Size of one pixel in mm
	gantry-tilt		Gantry tilt of the examination in degrees
	front-vector		vector pointing from "spine to chest " expressed in layer
				coordinates in the form (x,y,z) (see introduction)
	head-vector		vector pointing from "feet to head" expressed in layer
				coordinates in the form (x,y,z) (see introduction)
